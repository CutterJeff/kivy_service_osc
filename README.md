I'm using tshirtman's example as a starting point for a completely different project

For a long time, I had a Tasker/SL4A Python "app" on my cell phone that as a personal assistant of sorts.
Then the phone broke, I went to a new phone, and now ... no more SL4A.

I'm missing the "Lady In the Box" / LIBby

I had this epiphany long ago that voice recognition isn't reliable (back then it wasn't) and having the assistant monitor
as many sensors and inputs as possible and come up with it's own actions was easier and more reliable... and more fun.
Libby would kick off on demand, or 15 minutes when moving at less than 30mph, or every 5 minutes while driving, or when a
notification came through the phone. 
She'd make various comments depending on the situation, then go back to sleep. 

For example, if the Calendar put a notification of an impending meeting, Libby would harvest the meeting name from the notification, 
then search the database and come up with a wise-ass comment about the upcoming meeting. 

My intent is to recode it with Kivy, as a user-interaction activity (to take up the Tasker widgets part) and a background process
(to do the Tasker/SL4A part)
